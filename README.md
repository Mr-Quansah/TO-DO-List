Project Overview: To-Do List Application

Objective: Build a simple web-based to-do list application where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The app will use local storage to save tasks, ensuring they persist even after refreshing the page.

Features
Add Task: Users can enter and add a task to the list.
Mark as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, which will visually differentiate completed tasks from pending ones.
Delete Task: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.
Persistent Storage: The app saves tasks in local storage, so they remain available after the page reloads.

Tech Stack
HTML: Structure the web application.
CSS: Style the application.
JavaScript: Implement the functionality.
